step 1: get input from user
step 2: if input less than 1 or greater than 8 go back to step 1
step 3: iterate from 0 through 7 i.e less than height 8
            on each iteration print a new line
step 4:     set space to height -1, as long as space is greater than block_i, keep decrementing space
            on each iteration, print spaces
step 5:     set block_j equal to block_i, as long as block_j equal or greater than 0, keep decrementing block_j
            on each iteration, print hashes
