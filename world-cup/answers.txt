Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

when N = 10  --> team info for men world cup wrong
when N = 100 -->

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

after 100000 simulations I would consider the predictions good enough - as I can run more simulations with still relatively fast running time of under 1 sec
