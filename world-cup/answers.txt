Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

As the number of simulations is increased, the time, in total, for the program to run is also increased

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

after 100000 simulations I would consider the predictions good enough - as I can run more simulations with still relatively fast running time of under 1 sec
