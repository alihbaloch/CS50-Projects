Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

when N = 10  --> team info for men world cup wrong
when N = 100 --> all correct
when N = 1000 --> all correct
when N = 10000 --> all correct
when N = 100000 --> does not correctly keep track of wins
when N = 1000000 --> does not correctly keep track of wins, does not correctly report team info for men world cup or women world cup

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

after 1000 simulations I would consider the predictions good enough - as I can run more number of simulations without loosing accuracy and with still relatively fast program running times
