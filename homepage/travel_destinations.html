                        My first stop in Canada was Halifax, Nova Scotia. The coastal charm and friendly locals instantly won me over. Exploring historic sites like the Halifax Citadel and Peggy's Cove, enjoying delicious seafood, and spotting whales in the Atlantic were unforgettable experiences. Halifax's warm atmosphere and maritime heritage left a lasting impression on me, making it a perfect start to my Canadian adventure.
