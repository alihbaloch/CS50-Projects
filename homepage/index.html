            <h2>A Little About Myself.</h2>
            <p1>Hi, I'm Ali, and my story begins in the vibrant and culturally rich country of Pakistan.
                Growing up in the bustling streets of my hometown, I was always curious and eager to learn about the diverse tapestry of traditions, languages, and customs that surrounded me.
                Those early days in Pakistan shaped my worldview and instilled in me an appreciation for my heritage and an open-mindedness that would become my guiding principles.</p2>
