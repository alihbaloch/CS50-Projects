HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE A PERSON'S AUDIO AURA?:


We can identify or characterize a person's audio aura or personal signature by evaluating the averages of the energy, valence and danceability of their top 100 songs,
I suppose this way, we can identify an individuals own personal signature/mood or taste by identifying what their particular taste in music is.


WHY THIS MIGHT NOT BE VERY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE INDIVIDUAL? / BETTER WAYS TO EVALUATE?:


This might not be very representative of the individual because taste in music is subjective. What an individual necessarily listen to, perhaps might not be
typical of their personality/mood or characteristics they exhibit. For example, listening to sad songs does not necessarily mean that an individual is sad or unhappy,
and this might lead them to feel entirely different depending on the individual. Also, the way the categories are defined does not seem to have any objective
metric to it, who decides what what they mean? Perhaps a better way of calculating an individuals aura could be by determining the type of genre of music they listen to,
and then evaluating the top 100 songs genre for that individual. If the majority for e.g 80% of genre is determined to be hip-hop, then give them an appropriate grading
of color such as 'orange' (Oranges are the rebellious and bold type. They share a need for high-energy, confidence-boosting sounds.) or similar.
